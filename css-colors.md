There are many ways to tell css a color.

* There're the prebind colors, like `black`, `blue`, `green`...
* There're the hexdecimal colors, like `#23a3bb`, `#69dac0`...
* There're the rgb colors, like `rgb(255, 123, 42)`...
* And there're the rgba colors, like `rgba(255, 123, 42, 0.5)`...

The `a` paramether varies from $1$ to $0$.

```
/* color for text */
color: black;
```
