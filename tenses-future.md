# Future

The future is any time after now.

We can use future tenses in a formal way or in a informal way.

If we're talking about a formal situation, we must use the help verb **will**.

But if it is an informal situation, the sentense can be about a planned or
unplanned thing. It it's planned, we must use **going to** or the **present
continuous**, and if it's unplanned, we must use **will**.

* *I'm going to meet John tomorrow* (planned, informal);
* *I'm meeting John tomorrow* (planned, informal);
* *Okay, I'll meet John tomorrow* (unplanned, informal);
* *I will meet Mr. Williams tomorrow* (formal);

## Future Simple

We can use future simple in many situation:

* formal
    * *The ceremony will begin at eight o'clock.*
* planned
    * *the doctor will see you at three p.m.*
* business
    * *ABC Company will open a new factory.*
* predicting
    * *Experts say food prices will rise.*
* informal
    * *I'll call you later*.
* unplanned
    * *Hey, I'll give you a ride to the subway.*
* ordering
    * *I'll have a small cheese pizza.*
* promising
    * *I'll return your book tomorrow.*
* offering
    * *I'll help you finish the report.*
* possibility
    * *Maybe I'll take a break and watch a movie tonight.*

#### Sentense structure

**Subject + will + verb**

**Will + subject + verb?**

**Subject + will not (won't) ++ verb**

#### Shall word

In a very formal (old) English, the word **shall** is used instead of will. Now
a days, it's not used in the US in sentenses like

*I shall go there.*

but it can be used to make a polite question like

* *Shall I order ... ?*
* *Shall I bring ... ?*
* *Shall we dance?*
* *Shall we begin?*

That's more used with I and we.

#### Irregular verbs

In the future, verbs are always in the base form, it doesn't metter if it is a
regular or irregular verb.

* *I'll work tomorrow*.
* *They'll go there*.

#### If conditions

One advanced topic is using if conditions in sentenses like:

*If I will visit Greece, I will call you*.

That's a **mistake**. In English, when we have a if clause and a main clause,
like in the expression above, we must keep the if clause in the simple present.

* **If I visit Greece, I will call you**.
* **I will call you if I visit Greece**.

We also have the same topic with other condition words: when, as soon as,
before, after:

* **When I visit Greece, I'll call you.**
* **Before I visit Greece, I'll call you.**
* **I'll call you as soon as I visit Greece.**
