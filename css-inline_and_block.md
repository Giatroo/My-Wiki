The elements in our page have a _display_ property.

That can be of many types, two of them being _block_ and _inline_.

* When an object has display equals to block, that means it will occupy the
  entire line. So if we have a text with a paragraph with a single `a`, that
  will occupy the entire line (unless we change it's display mode).
* On the other hand, when an object has display equals inline, that means it
  will occupy just the space of the element (and the border, padding and
  margin). Moreover, we can insert multiple elements in the same line if they
  have the property inline, one on the side of each other.

Block elements can have custom _width_ and _height_ values.

Some elements have different default values. `divs`, `sections`, `headers`,
`footers`, `ps` and many others are block elements by default.
