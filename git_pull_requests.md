## Forks

**Forking** a public repository means we're going to create a copy of a existing
repository of somebody into your repositories. When you have a fork of a
repository, you can edit the forked repository the way you want and it will not
change the original repository.

## Pull requests

When you begin working with a forked repository, you might want to submit your
changes to the original repository (which is not yours). What's a pull request.
You submit your work (on one of your branches) to the original repository and
the owner of that repository decides if he accepts your pull request or not.

In many situations, if you're trying to contribute to an Open Source code, you
might need to follow some rules in your pull request, like having just one
commit inside your branch.
