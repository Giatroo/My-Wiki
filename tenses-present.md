# Present

The two main ways to express the present in English are the **Present Simple**
(*I work*) and the **Present Continuous** (or **Progressive**) (*I am working*).

The **Present Continuous** express an ideia about something that I happening
when the phrase is been pronunciated, in the current time (now). It's something
temporary.

And the **Present Simple** express an ideia about something permanent, general.
I might not be working right now, but when I say *I work at that company.* it
means that I have a job there.

## Present Simple

Present Simple can be used in five main ways:

* Permanent Situations:
    * *We live in New York.*
    * *He works at a bank.*
* Routines:
    * *I wake up at 6:00.*
    * *I go to sleep at 11:00.*
* Facts:
    * *The sun rises in the east.*
* Schedules:
    * *Our class starts at 9:00.*
    * *The flight leaves at noon.*
* Frequency (adverbs of frequency):
    * *She **always** takes the bus.*

## Present Continuous

Present Continuous can be used in six main ways:

* Now:
    * *The baby is sleeping.*
* Around now:
    * He is writing a book.
* Temporary:
    * We are staying at a hotel.
* Trend:
    * The prices of homes are increasing.
    * People are wearing blue clothes.
* Repeated action:
    * They are always making noise.
    * Adverbs of frequency can be used to express negative meaning phrases.
* Future:
    * She's flying to Mexico next week.
    * To use present continuous to express the future, we need an adverb of
      future, like *next week*.

We **can't** use Present Continuous when speaking about permanent things:
* *I'm living in Canada.*
* *I'm working at ABC Company.*

#### Stative Verbs

And we **can't** use Present Continuous with some special verbs called **stative
verbs**:
* *I am **understanding** English.*
* *We are **liking** the show.*
* *They are **having** a car.*
* *Are you **needing** help?*

## Present Perfect

The *present perfect* connects the present and the past. This tenso show us that
an action in the past has a result in the present, or an effect in the present.

For instance, we can compare the past simple and the present perfect:

* *I **lost** my book.*
* *I **have lost** my book.*

Is there any difference? Indeed there is.

In the first sentence, I could lost my book on Monday and then found it on
Tuesday. But in the second one, I lost my on somewhen and **that's still true
today**.

#### Sentense structure

To create a sentense in the present perfect, we use:

**Subject + have/has + verb in the past participe**

**Have/Has + subject + verb in the past participe?**

**Subject + have/has not (haven't/hasn't) + verb in the past participe.**

#### Usage

We can use the present perfect in many situations:

* **past that is still true**
    * *I have seen that movie.*
    * *I have found my keys.*
* **past finished**
    * *She has finished her homework.*
    * *They have cooked dinner.*
* **past unfinished**
    * *I have worked here for five years. (and I still work here today)*
    * *He has lived here since 2012.*
* **(recent) past result**
    * *I have just eaten lunch.*
    * *She has just sent the email.*
* **past repetitive**
    * *I have shopped here for many years.*

There are some common words that appear in the present perfect tense, like
**already**, **yet**, **just**, **since**, **ever**, **never** and **for**.

Let's look at some finished and unfinished examples:

* **finished**
    * *I have already read that book.*
    * *Our team has just won the game.*
* **unfinished**
    * *She has worked here for three months.*
    * *She has worker here since January.*
    * *The flight has not arrived yet.*
    * *Have you ever been to Italy?*
    * *He has never eaten sushi.*
    * *How long have you known each other?*

The word **for** is used with a *period* of time and **since** is used with a
*point* in time.
The word **yet** means something like *until now*.

**We cannot use present perfect with a finisehd time expression!**

* *I spoke to him threee times **last week**.*
* ***When** did you meet John?*
* ***When** did you visit Spain?*

But you can use it with a **unfinished time expression**:

* *I've spoken to him three times **this week**.*
* ***How long** have you known John?*
* ***Have you ever** visited Spain?*

An unfinished time expression is some expression like: **this week**, **this
year**, **today**, **in my life**, ...

### Past Participle

#### Regular verbs

Regular verbs are those we just add *-ed* in the past simple. In the **past
participle**, those verbs remain exactly the same as in the past simple (we just
add *-ed* or do some modifications before it).

#### Irregular verbs

Irregular verbs are those that don't have a rule to change their form into the
past simple. Every irregular verb in the past simple is also an irregular verb
in the past participle and, therefore, we need to memorize them.

Where's a little table with some common verbs:
