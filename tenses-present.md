# Present

The two main ways to express the present in English are the **Present Simple**
(*I work*) and the **Present Continuous** (or **Progressive**) (*I am working*).

The **Present Continuous** express an ideia about something that I happening
when the phrase is been pronunciated, in the current time (now). It's something
temporary.

And the **Present Simple** express an ideia about something permanent, general.
I might not be working right now, but when I say *I work at that company.* it
means that I have a job there.

## Present Simple

Present Simple can be used in five main ways:

* Permanent Situations:
    * *We live in New York.*
    * *He works at a bank.*
* Routines:
    * *I wake up at 6:00.*
    * *I go to sleep at 11:00.*
* Facts:
    * *The sun rises in the east.*
* Schedules:
    * *Our class starts at 9:00.*
    * *The flight leaves at noon.*
* Frequency (adverbs of frequency):
    * *She **always** takes the bus.*

## Present Continuous

Present Continuous can be used in six main ways:

* Now:
    * *The baby is sleeping.*
* Around now:
    * He is writing a book.
* Temporary:
    * We are staying at a hotel.
* Trend:
    * The prices of homes are increasing.
    * People are wearing blue clothes.
* Repeated action:
    * They are always making noise.
    * Adverbs of frequency can be used to express negative meaning phrases.
* Future:
    * She's flying to Mexico next week.
    * To use present continuous to express the future, we need an adverb of
      future, like *next week*.

We **can't** use Present Continuous when speaking about permanent things:
* *I'm living in Canada.*
* *I'm working at ABC Company.*

#### Stative Verbs

And we **can't** use Present Continuous with some special verbs called **stative
verbs**:
* *I am **understanding** English.*
* *We are **liking** the show.*
* *They are **having** a car.*
* *Are you **needing** help?*
