# Past

## Simple Past

Simple Past tells about something that happend in the past (before **now**) and
is over, completed.

We can use it with or without a *time expression*:
* *Brian called **last week***.
* *I cooked dinner*.

To talk about a recent or distant past:
* *We visited her yesterday*.
* *She lived in London a long time ago*.

One action or many actions:
* *She talked to her manager*.
* *They invited their friends, ordered pizza, and watched the game*.

#### Questions and Negatives

To make a questions and negative sentenses, we use the helping verb **do** in
the past: **did**, and the verb must stay in the base form.

* *We did not (didn't) work yesterday*
* Did you work yesterday?

You can also make a negative question or use a question word:
* *Didn't they work yesterday?*
* *Where did you they yesterday?*

#### Regular vs Irregular verbs

The **regular verbs** are the ones that in the past are ended with **-ed**.

* *worked*
* *cleaned*
* *watched*

And the **irregulars** are the ones that change their form:

* *go -> went*
* *see -> saw*
* *buy -> bought*

Some of them change a little and some change a lot.

Let's start with the regular verbs:

##### Regular verbs

With some verbs, we just need to add **-ed**:
* *walk -> walked*
* *cook -> cooked*

But sometimes, that's not true.
If the verb already ends with **-e**, we must just add **-d**:
* *bake -> baked*
* *use -> used*

And if it ends with **-y**, we must remove it and add **-ied**:
* *cry -> cried*
* *study -> studied*

And, finally, if the verb ends in consonant + vowel + consonant, we double the
last letter and add **-ed**:
* *stop -> stopped*
* *plan -> planned*

##### Irregular verbs

There's no rule to learn irregular verb. I need to memorize it (there are some
patterns, but no rule).

* *forget -> forgot*
* *sleep -> slept*
* *teach -> taught*
* *speak -> spook*
* *hurt -> hurt*
* *know -> knew*
* *meet -> met*
* *give -> gave*
* *leave -> left*
* *understand -> understood*
* *write -> wrote*
* *wake up -> woke up*
* *speak -> spoke*
* *have -> had*
* *pay -> paid*
* *...*

## Past Continuous (Progressive)

When we use Past Simple, we're talking about a thing that happend in a **point**
in the past. But if the action is longer, continuous, we need to use the Past
Continuous, to emphasize that the action took a longer time, a period of time.

We use it to talk about:

* **An continuous action during a period of time:**
    * *Sarah was studying all day*.
* **An continuous action during a moment:**
    * *At 11:00pm, I was sleeping*.
* **Continuous action when interruped:**
    * *They were having dinner when we arrived*.
* **A planned action:**
    * *I was planning to call John, but I didn't have time*.
* **A polite request:**
    * *I was wondering if you could help me*.

#### Stative Verbs

As in Present Continuous, in the Past Continuous we can't use Stative Verbs.

All these sentenses are wrong:
* *I was knowking him for many years*.
* *Susan was hating spiders*.
* *They were owning a big house*.
* *We were wanting to call you*.
* *She was needing to catch her flight*.
* *He was having a computer*.

But, be careful, **to have** can have many meanings. The phrase
* *He was having a party.*

is right.

#### Sentense structure

The basic structure is:

**Subject + was/were + (verb + ing)**

* *I was working*
* *You were working*

*Obs.:* was and were are the verb *to be* in the past.

##### Negative and Questions sentenses

To make the sentense negative, we use **were/was not** and to make it negative,
we change the order, bringing the to be to the begining:
* *I was not (wasn't) working*
* *They were not (weren't) working*
* *Was she working?*
* *Were they working?*
